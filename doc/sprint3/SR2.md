# Sprint Retrospective

Good Practices: 
Being proactive when learning and implementing features
Had meetings often
Had a final meeting where work was checked and documentations were formatted
Good communication when implementing a feature and some restrictions that might come with the feature
Everyone did their stand-up update after the meeting
Our google doc documentation was organized

Bad Practices:
Donâ€™t finish your user story before the last meeting
Dropping the course on the last day of submission 
Not running the code you want to merge
Merging and finishing the feature on the last day
Doing lots of documentation last minute
