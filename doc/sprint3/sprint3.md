Sprint Goal:
Make our web app more similar to a social media platform by implementing all the user stories we assigned for this sprint which includes commenting on posts, a frontend for an official pages, users being able to make post that includes pictures, and most importantly, users being able to register and login to accounts.

Spikes/Blockers:
Patricia Midori Nagatani: Co-op 9am to 5pm, A1 Assignment
Ilya Kostin: TAing MATA31, one more midterm, and A1 C01
Howie Chen: general course stuff
Mario Liao: One more midterm coming up and needing to finish C01 assignment
Yangkun Li: Too many things to deal with immigration.

Team Capacity: (We use an exponent of 2 rating, so 2 = lowest difficulty, and 32 = highest difficulty) With our rating, our team capacity is 8+4+8+8+8+8 = 44.
