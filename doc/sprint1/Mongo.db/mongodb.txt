mongoDB -> The "M" in MERN Stack

Non-SQL database - Stores data in collections, the individual records are called documents

The documents have a key value structure that looks like json

Advantages:
1. Performance - speed of querying
2. Flexibility - Easy to add a new field
3. Scalability - Supports large databases with high requests rates at low latency 
4. Usability - Easy/Fast to run in the cloud 

Official website: mongodb.com

When you enter mongodb.com and login, you will need to create a new project and start your database. 

You can select all default settings as it wil be free. 

Creating Data:
On the left menu, go to Databases>Collections to see your data
Then Add my Own Data 

Access:
On the left menu, go to Database Access and create new user:
User: Manager
Password: Password
Role: readWriteanyDatabase

Connecting:
On the left menu, go to Databases and click Connect
Select to allow from any location and add the default IP address
Then select Connect your application
It gives a connection string, now you need to replace the password in that string and replace the "myFirstDatabase" with the Company.db (name we gave)
!!! The video is from 10 months ago, there's no need to replace the database name anymore

Connection string:
mongodb+srv://Manager:Password@cluster0.ijlyyyc.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Add it in .env file assigned to DATABASE_URI

Is a library that makes working with mongoDB easier

Learn the MERN Stack - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M&t=3431s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

First tutorial didn't fully worked, so the code refers to the link above

Create a backend file, and run "npm init -y" on your terminal

Libraries: 
    express - webframework for node.js
    cors - "cross origin resource sharing", allows ajax requests to skip the origin policy and access resources from remote hosts
    mongoosejs - makes working with mongoDB easier
    dotenv - Loads environment variables from a .end file into process.end, makes development easier (it stores development variables in a file instead of the machine)
    nodemon - Helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when files are changed
