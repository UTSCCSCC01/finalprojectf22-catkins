# Sprint Retrospective

Good Practices: 
Being proactive when learning and implementing features
Had meetings often
Had a final meeting where work was checked and documentations were formatted
Good communication when implementing a feature and some restrictions that might come with the feature
Everyone did their stand-up update after the meeting
Our google doc documentation was organized
Burndown chart was maintained properly for this sprint
Work on documentation was split up on multiple days instead of last day

Bad Practices:
Not running the code you want to merge
Merging and finishing the feature on the last day
Submitting on last day
Planning the date for the next meeting was messy and often needed to be rescheduled
