Sprint Goal:
Make our web app more similar to a social media platform by implementing all the user stories we assigned for this sprint which includes more features for club pages, users being able to create and register accounts, our application recognizing which user is logged in and act accordingly to that, and making the app overall more aesthetically pleasing with more styling, pictures, and animations.
