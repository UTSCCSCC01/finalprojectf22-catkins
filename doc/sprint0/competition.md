Identifies existing products (and possibly provides URLs) that solve the same (or similar) problem as yours.  
○ Existing products that solve the same (or similar) problem are Facebook pages, Instagram pages, Twitter, Discord, Piazza, DistrictUNI

How is your product different?  
○ Our product takes the key features from each one of those competitors and puts everything in one place. Our product is also UTSC focus, so that all UTSC-related courses, clubs, programs, etc, will be condensed into one social media platform for students and professors to use.

If your product is better for specific users and/or specific scenarios,  
○ Students don’t need to create a specific social media account or keep looking on university websites for information. They can use Catkins to see relevant information and events on their feed. They can join course forums to ask questions anonymously. Also data will be stored within the UofT environment, and won’t be accessible to 3rd parties (unlike what Facebook, piazza do with it).

Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?  
○ Users will be generally split into 3 groups of people, UTSC students, UTSC professors, and UTSC department representatives. If you are a UTSC student, you might be a first-year student and be really lost when learning about clubs, what courses to take, how to succeed in your program, etc. With CatKins, these first-year students should easily be able to find clubs, courses, and other students for information. UTSC professors might not like Facebook and how they might use your information, with CatKins the information will be stored in the UTSC environment. UTSC department representatives will want to use Catkins to post about upcoming events happening so that students can see them in their feeds.

Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so?  
○ Competitors' focus is on a broader audience, and we want to make it relevant for the University of Toronto community. They could give verification for big university pages (Registrar’s Office), but verifying small clubs can be proven difficult as they can be abandoned at any time.
