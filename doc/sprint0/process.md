● How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?
To organize the team, everyone initially individually contributed to creating user stories (features wanting to be implemented) and UI design, while in meetings we discussed these and ruled out those not agreed upon as a group. We also discussed as a group what database to use along with certain frameworks to start implementing the project. We used the sample discord server to hold meetings and take notes but also used google docs to write up the required documents. Everyone was doing the tasks they were comfortable with and then discussed the work done with the team. We spitted the team into 2 groups of three, for frontend and backend based on people’s skills. Further distribution of work within each team will be done as we get closer to development. To start off we will have 3 people working frontend, 3 people working backend, and it will be chosen based on people’s preferences.

● How did you make decisions?
To make decisions everyone contributed possible decisions, and after some discussion, we voted to choose the best idea(s). 

● How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
We defined our priority for our user stories by playing a poker game, and after each round, if we did not all get the same points, people with the lowest number will discuss why they chose that number and people with the highest number will discuss why they chose that number, and then we would go to another round. On average, it took 3 rounds for us to come to a consensus.

 ● How frequently did you meet? 
We will meet up twice a week, and maybe sometimes even more depending on how much we finish with the deadline coming up.

● What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
For the future, we will be posting reminders on upcoming meetings using the event functionality on Discord. In the future meetings, we will want everyone to be prepared and read handouts before meetings so that we can maximize our meeting time.
