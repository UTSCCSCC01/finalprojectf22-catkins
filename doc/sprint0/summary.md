Objective: Social platform for University of Toronto students to have an official place to find information and interact with other students and university organizations. The web application will allow department/club representatives to post about relevant events and information, professors to create forums for course discussion and students to find a place to find reliable information. The main focus is on UTSC, other campuses students can also join (as they might be taking UTSC courses), but all courses and department information will be relevant only to UTSC

Key Personas:
Ava-Rose - 31-year-old Co-op department head, who wants UTSC students not to miss her department’s career events 
Lucas - 40-year-old CS professor in UTSC, who wants students to start discussions on topics he teaches, but is afraid of getting his students’ data leak
Olivia - 18-year-old econ student at UTSC, who wants to improve the world with the help of her major and make new friends in UTSC and/or people with the same goal

Key Scenario: 
Olivia has recently accepted their admission offer and wants to know how to make friends. Looking on Facebook and Instagram for clubs, it’s difficult to know if the clubs are official. When looking at the official club's website from UTSC, several clubs are outdated and are not running anymore. Overall the experience of finding new clubs to join is too complicated for them.Put
Lucas wants students to feel comfortable asking questions. However, the students are too shy to ask questions during class. They might also have questions outside of lectures when reviewing the material. Lucas does not like to use Piazza for reasons of online privacy, and he knows students would rather make groups on other, more trendy apps to talk about the course. On Catkins, he would be able to create a course forum, invite students by their university e-mail and allow them to ask questions anonymously more efficiently and familiarly. 
Ava-Rose works for the International Student Center (ISC) and hosts several events about Exchanges and Summer Abroad programs. However, attendance is always low, with students saying they’ve never even heard about the event. Ava-Rose sends newsletters through emails, but not many students end up viewing them. They also would like students to know about other scholarship opportunities, allowing students to ask for budgets to attend career-changing events. They could post on Catkins so students can see information in their feeds. 



Key Principle:
Carefully plan all objectives before starting coding, so that we can deliver our project to students faster 
Put UTSC community needs first when thinking about user stories and how they would be beneficial for the community 
Customer is the top priority, and must always be above the tech stack and efficiency of the project
