# Sprint Retrospective

Good Practices: 
Being proactive when learning and implementing features
Had meetings often
Had a final meeting where work was checked and documentations were formatted
Good communication when implementing a feature and some restrictions that might come with the feature
Everyone did their stand-up update after the meeting
Our google doc documentation was organized

Bad Practices:
Don’t be shy and ask for help when stuck
Started the sprint late
Merging and finishing the feature on the last day
Dev branch being broken at one point
Merge without a pull request
Some branch names didn’t include the User Story and CAT number (task)
Deleted some branches
